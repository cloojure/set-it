THESE are the times that try men's souls. The summer
soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis,
shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands
by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have
this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the
more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we
esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every
thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon
its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an
article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated.
